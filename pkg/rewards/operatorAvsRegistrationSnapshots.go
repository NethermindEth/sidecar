// Operator AVS Registration Windows: Ranges at which an operator has registered for an AVS
// 0. Ranked: Rank the operator state changes by block_time and log_index since sqlite lacks LEAD/LAG functions
// 1. Marked_statuses: Denote which registration status comes after one another
// 2. Removed_same_day_deregistrations: Remove a pairs of (registration, deregistration) that happen on the same day
// 3. Registration_periods: Combine registration together, only select registrations with:
// a. (Registered, Unregistered)
// b. (Registered, Null). If null, the end time is the current timestamp
// 4. Registration_snapshots: Round up each start_time to  0 UTC on NEXT DAY and round down each end_time to 0 UTC on CURRENT DAY
// 5. Operator_avs_registration_windows: Ranges that start and end on same day are invalid
// Note: We cannot assume that the operator is registered for avs at end_time because it is
// Payments calculations should only be done on snapshots from the PREVIOUS DAY. For example say we have the following:
// <-----0-------1-------2------3------>
// ^           ^
// Entry        Exit
// Since exits (deregistrations) are rounded down, we must only look at the day 2 snapshot on a pipeline run on day 3.
