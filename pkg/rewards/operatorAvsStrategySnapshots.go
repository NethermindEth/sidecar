// Operator AVS Strategy Windows: Ranges for which an Operator, Strategy is restaked on an AVS
// 1. Ranked_records: Order all records. Round up block_time to 0 UTC
// 2. Latest_records: Get latest records for each (operator, avs, strategy, day) combination
// 3. Grouped_records: Find the next start_time for each (operator, avs, strategy) combination
// 4. Parsed_ranges: Complicated step. Here, we set end_time = start_time in three cases:
// Case 1: end_time is null because there are no more RPC calls made. For example, if today is 4/28 and
// the start_time is 4/27 (rounded from 4/26), there is nothing we can do on the (4/27, 4/28)
// range since it has not ended.
// Case 2: end_time is null because the (operator, strategy) combo is no longer registered
// Case 3: end_time is more than 1 day greater than start_time. In this case, if there is a new range,
// it will be accounted for. Say we have a range (4/21, 4/22, 4/23), (4/23, 4/25), (4/25, 4/26).
// The second range will be discarded since its not contiguous. We will keep (4/21-4/23) and (4/25-4/26)
// 5. Active_windows: Parse out all rows whose start_time == end_time (see above conditions)
// 6. Gaps_and_islands: Mark the previous end time for each row. If null, then start of a range
// 7. Island_detection: Mark islands if the previous end time is equal to the start time
// 8. Island_groups: Group islands by summing up ids
// 9. Operator_avs_strategy_windows: Combine ranges with same id
